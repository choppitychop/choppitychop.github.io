			<p>Dear Hiring Manager,</p>
			<p>I recently had the opportunity to connect with your recruitment consultant, Joe Bloggs, regarding the open position for an Account Assistant. I am excited to convey my keen interest in applying for this role. With experience in an accounting environment as an audit associate, I am actively seeking a challenging role with an ambitious company to further enhance my professional development.
			</p>
			<p>
			My professional background includes a tenure as an audit associate at Ernst & Young (EY). Throughout this time, I collaborated with diverse audit teams and clients, managing a client portfolio spanning data networking, cloud services, appliance provision, warehousing and logistics, as well as building materials.</p>
			<p>In my capacity as an audit associate, I assumed responsibility for executing audit procedures related to various income statement and balance sheet accounts, such as cash and bank, administrative expenses, fixed assets, prepayments, and accounts payable. This includes the preparation of Excel worksheets, wherein I meticulously documented the conducted substantive testing. This testing involved tasks like sampling, validating supporting documents, reconciling balances, and conducting analytical reviews.
			</p>
			<p>Throughout my tenure at EY, I consistently showcased robust core skills and adeptness at efficient learning. I proactively leveraged available resources, which allowed me to tackle increasingly complex tasks. As a result, I made significant contributions to audit teams, ensuring the delivery of high-quality audits. I take pride in the recognition I received from my seniors and managers, who evaluated me as a high performer.
			</p>
			<p>I am particularly enthusiastic about the prospect of discussing the Accounts Assistant role in more depth and sharing insights about my experiences. I am confident that this role aligns well with my aspirations. I sincerely appreciate your time and consideration.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>Best regards,</p>
			<p>John Michael Grageda</p>
